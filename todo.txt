Needs folding

Try some stylish rounded corners?

Consider using Shift+Arrows for indent instead of tab, so it's consistent with the other movement commands

needs some global actions, outside the text boxes
  perhaps hitting next/prev while nothing is selected should select the first or last item

this autogrow library stinks: it's ignoring my options, and it only grows every few miliseconds.  Why not check on keystrokes?  You'd need to keep it from over-animating, but still, shouldn't be too hard to do with this for reference.  I want it to act differently anyway: I don't want it to leave extra space for writing!  It should wrap tightly.
  
when I add folding, add ".visible" to the indent/etc selectors

Perhaps I could make a keystroke editor eventually...
