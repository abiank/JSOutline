- version variable, use it in 'restore' to not mess things up when events change

- test in IE

- Oh shit, undo/redo on indent/dedent isn't accurate!
  - dedenting causes it to lose its place.  It should remember where it was before so it can un-dedent correctly.

- redesign
  - use classes instead of attrs for speed
  - make key controls configurable

- persistence
  - show space remaining
  - gears
  - flashStorage
  - url/hash
  - server-side (premium?)
  - allow you to switch storage methods at runtime, porting over stuff?  remember which one?

- todo_item functionality
  - mark as task or reference
  - check off tasks
  - clean up button
  - show/hide finished tasks

- publicity
  - post on my blog
  - make an icon on my website

- other useful commands 
  - create child
  - create parent
  - fold all (top level)
  - Group -- how would I implement this in text mode, adopt siblings?
  - If delete_reparent is useful, find a way to undo it gracefully.  It's so destructive!
  - move node to next/previous parent
  - focus on single or set of nodes?

- silly ideas
  - ncurses client
  - omnifocus import


Persistence button with gears.  Maybe a simple cookie-based store too.

Perhaps have a 'force sync' button to sync to the web

this autogrow library stinks: it's ignoring my options, and it only grows every few miliseconds.  Why not check on keystrokes?  You'd need to keep it from over-animating, but still, shouldn't be too hard to do with this for reference.  I want it to act differently anyway: I don't want it to leave extra space for writing!  It should wrap tightly.

Dude, I could totally make an ncurses client for this :P

make an omnifocus merging tool
