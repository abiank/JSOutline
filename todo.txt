this autogrow library stinks: it's ignoring my options, and it only grows every few miliseconds.  Why not check on keystrokes?  You'd need to keep it from over-animating, but still, shouldn't be too hard to do with this for reference.  I want it to act differently anyway: I don't want it to leave extra space for writing!  It should wrap tightly.
  
Perhaps I could make a keystroke editor eventually...

Persistence: cookies, gears, web =]

Perhaps have a 'force sync' button to sync to the web
Premium account = sync to web

If delete_reparent is useful, find a way to undo it gracefully.  It's so destructive!

Is it useful to move something up or down in a way that re-parents it?  Kinda sorta.
